This process may take place in an indoor clinical setting, such as a veterinary clinic or hospital, and requires attention to detail, accuracy, and good communication skills. The primary challenge involved in this process is ensuring that the correct medication and dosage are administered to each patient. The duration of this process may vary depending on the number of patients and the types of medications being dispensed, but it typically takes between 15-30 minutes per patient. Medication dispensing is a frequent task that occurs multiple times a day, as needed. The risks associated with this process include medication errors, adverse reactions, and potential harm to the animal or handler. To mitigate these risks, veterinary technologists & technicians must follow established protocols and double-check all work before administering medication. The equipment used for this process includes syringes, medication cups, medication vials, and prescription labels. The localities involved in this process include the treatment room, where medications are prepared and administered, and the exam room, where animals are evaluated and diagnosed.
